## Task
1. Add `Book Now` button on admin/doctors.php/doctors list/view doctor
Done: I let users go to book now page if click `book now` button on doctor detail view.
But client asked me to let `book now` functionality without navigating to the book now page.
I was updating that one... please update a little...

2. Add `procedure` on doctor detail view:
Done: I added procedure field on specialists table
The clients asked me to remove all other specialists from table except 2 records.
you can compare edoc_origin.sql, edoc_update.sql in the root directory.

3. Mobile Responsive
This should be done by 2 days. The client asked me to finish this one by 1 day but I explained that the code is in low quality(for design, previous developer used table, tr, td tags) and I need to update almost code to make mobile responsive.
So it should be done by Sunday.
But almost views are using same template, so It will not difficult to make mobile responsive

## Budget
- 500$
He agreed with this budget but I raised up by explaining I need to update almost code to make mobile responsive.
He said I can name the price once all tasks are done.
I hope budget can be 800$ or so... :)
- Payment Method
Paypal or Crypto(Crypto is prefer)

## Test
